## Troubleshooting

### I can't reach Quark in my browser

- Make sure Quark is powered on
- Make sure you're on the same WiFi network as your Quark device
- Try `http://quark.home.local` — if you changed the hostname during setup, use that instead
- Try restarting your router and your Quark device

### I'm getting an error when I try to install Quark

Make sure you're using the installer for your operating system and architecture. The [nerd notes](/docs/nerd-notes)
page has installation details. If you're still stuck,
[open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/autobutler-org/quark/issues) and someone will help.

### Quark doesn't work with my VPN

This is expected. Quark runs entirely on your local network — connecting through a VPN routes traffic outside your
home, so the two conflict. Disable your VPN when accessing Quark on your home network. (We're working on built-in
remote access so you won't need a third-party VPN to reach it from outside your home.)

### I'm having performance issues

1. Check the **Health** page in Quark — high disk usage or high temperatures can cause slowdowns
2. In Settings, click **Export Performance Metrics** — this saves recent health data to a `metrics.sqlite` file
3. Share that file in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/autobutler-org/quark/issues) or email it to
   [support@autobutler.org](mailto:support@autobutler.org) and we'll take a look

### My files aren't showing up after I uploaded them

Try refreshing the page. If they still don't appear, check that your upload completed successfully (the progress
indicator should have reached 100%). Very large files can take a minute.
