## Stack

| Layer         | Technology                                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend       | Go + [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)                           |
| Frontend      | [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) (web, iOS, Android)                     |
| Database      | SQLite via [modernc.org/sqlite](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite) |
| Migrations    | [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)            |
| DB queries    | [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev)                                               |
| API docs      | [Swagger/swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag)                         |
| Observability | [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io)                              |

The backend is a single Go binary that serves both the REST API and the Flutter web build.
On first boot it runs database migrations automatically.

## Installation

### Download and install a release

```bash
# Stop the running service if upgrading
sudo systemctl stop quark

OS="$(uname -s)"
ARCH="$(uname -m)"
case "$ARCH" in
  aarch64) ARCH="arm64";;
  x86_64)  ARCH="x86_64";;
esac

curl --fail -L \
  "https://github.com/autobutler-org/quark/releases/latest/download/quark_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz" \
  | tar -xvz

sudo ./quark install
```

The `install` command registers Quark as a systemd service and starts it.
Once running, open `http://<device-ip>:80` in a browser.

### First boot

On first boot, the web UI shows a setup screen. Create your owner account — you'll get a
recovery phrase shown exactly once. Write it down. It's the only way to reset your password.

---

## API

The REST API is at `/api/v1/`. Swagger UI is at `http://<host>/swagger`.

### Authentication

All endpoints require a session token except `/auth/setup`, `/auth/login`,
`/auth/recover`, and `/auth/status`.

```bash
# Login
curl -s -X POST http://localhost/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"you","password":"your-password"}'
# → {"token":"<64-char hex token>"}

# Use the token
curl http://localhost/api/v1/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Tokens are valid for 30 days. Pass them as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or as a
`session` cookie.

### Key endpoints

| Method | Path                                        | What it does                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/v1/health`                            | System health (CPU, memory, disk, temperature) |
| GET    | `/api/v1/cirrus`                            | List files                                     |
| POST   | `/api/v1/cirrus/upload/{path}`              | Upload a file                                  |
| GET    | `/api/v1/storage/devices/status`            | List storage devices                           |
| PATCH  | `/api/v1/storage/devices/{devicePath}/name` | Rename a device                                |
| GET    | `/api/v1/version`                           | Installed version                              |
| POST   | `/api/v1/version/latest`                    | Update to latest release                       |

## Architecture notes

**Single binary.** The Go backend embeds the Flutter web build at compile time and serves it
alongside the API. No separate web server needed.

**SQLite.** All state lives in a SQLite database at `/var/lib/quark/data/quark.db`.
Migrations run on startup — safe to upgrade without manual intervention.

**Device detection.** On Linux, Quark reads `/proc/mounts` to discover storage devices.
USB device detection uses the `usbutil` package. Mounting/unmounting USB storage requires
root — run with `AS_ROOT=1` in development.

**Auth.** Passwords are bcrypt-hashed (cost 12). Session tokens are 32 bytes of
`crypto/rand` (256-bit entropy). The recovery phrase is a 6-word phrase from a 256-word
wordlist (~48 bits — deliberate tradeoff for usability on a home device).

**Updates.** The device can update itself in-place via the `/version/update` API. It downloads
the new binary as a tarball, extracts it, and atomically renames it over the running binary.
The process exits and systemd restarts it.

## Development

**Prerequisites:** Go, Flutter, Make, [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air), sqlc, swag

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autobutler-org/quark.git
cd quark
make setup      # install dev tools
make generate   # sqlc + swag + flutter icons + sbom
make build      # build everything
```

### Run locally

```bash
make watch/backend          # backend with hot reload
make serve/frontend         # Flutter web
make emulate/android        # Android emulator
make serve/frontend/mobile  # Flutter mobile (after emulator is running)
```

### Useful targets

```bash
make check          # lint (Go + Flutter)
make format          # auto-format
make test            # run all tests
make coverage        # test coverage report
make help            # list all targets
```

Swagger UI is at `http://localhost:8080/swagger` when the backend is running locally.
